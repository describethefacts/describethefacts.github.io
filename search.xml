        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/pelosinancypaul.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her husband, Paul Pelosi, are on track for a hefty payday thanks to his latest bet on Nvidia stock, according to analysts that track the trades of members of Congress and their family members.</p><p>The California Democrat’s husband, Paul, who owns a San Francisco investment and consulting firm, scooped up between $1 million and $5 million worth of call options in computer chip company Nvidia on Nov. 22. Pelosi, however, held off on reporting the transaction until right before Christmas.</p><p>Nvidia is not new to the Pelosis. In 2022, Paul grabbed more than $1 million in Nvidia call options — which give investors the right to buy shares of a company at a specific price — just weeks before a congressional vote on providing massive subsidies to the chip manufacturing industry. He sold them after she received criticism over their timing. </p><p>The former House speaker has grabbed attention over the timing of several of her husband’s stock trades in the past. </p><p>Lawmakers’ spouses can trade in companies or industries their partner may help regulate, but it’s illegal for family members and members of Congress to profit from inside information. </p>]]></content>

      <title>The U.S. Housing Shortage is Getting Worse, Report Shows</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/GettyImages9774e1b.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>America’s chronic housing shortage, which has pushed up rents and home prices to increasingly unaffordable levels, is getting worse by the year.</p><p>That’s according to a newly published analysis by online real estate firm Zillow, which found that the U.S. had 4.5 million fewer homes than it needed in 2022, up from 4.3 million in 2021, as the population has increased much faster than the housing supply.</p><p>Economists have blamed the under-building of homes since the Great Recession for a host of economic woes, from the obvious—higher rent and housing costs—to the farther-flung, such as making the job market less efficient because it’s hard for workers to move to pursue the jobs that best suit them. </p><p>“The simple fact is there are not enough homes in this country, and that’s pushing homeownership out of reach for too many families,” Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow, said in a press release Tuesday. “Filling the housing shortage is the long-term answer to making housing more affordable. We are in a big hole, and it is going to take more than the status quo to dig ourselves out of it.”</p><p>Zillow calculated the housing shortfall by measuring how many people were living with roommates versus the number of homes available to rent or buy. There were 8.09 million people living with non-relatives, and 3.55 million units available, leaving a gap of 4.5 million.</p><p>While homebuilders have ramped up construction to meet this demand, they’ve faced challenges including rapidly rising costs for labor and building materials. Many economists and politicians also blame local zoning laws in municipalities across the country, which restrict new home construction.</p><p>In 2022, builders completed 1.4 million homes, according to Census data.That was short of the 1.8 million new families that formed that year, Zillow researchers said, citing Census data.</p><p>The housing shortage has hurt homebuyers by pushing up prices to record levels. It’s also hit renters hard. In 2022, a full 50% of renter households were “cost-burdened,” meaning they paid 30% or more of their income toward rent, and half of those cost-burdened renters paid at least 50% of their income toward rent according to an analysis by the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies.</p>]]></content>

Five months after rounds of US-led coalition airstrikes to “disrupt and degrade” their capabilities, the militants continue to wreak havoc. They’re routinely forcing the US-led task force to intercept their missiles, bomb boats, and flying drones that have turned shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden into a dangerous — and deadly — corridor.</p><p>The Houthis have struck multiple ships in the last week, and US officials say these attacks are unlikely to end anytime soon, raising concerns the US is stuck in a costly and unsustainable standoff.</p><p>The Houthis have managed to drag Washington into a prolonged, expensive, resource-depleting conflict and driven shipping costs much higher. While no American warships have been hit, the US must bear the growing financial costs and wear and tear to its warships.</p><p>Through their campaign, the rebels have not only proven their role as a formidable asset in Iran’s proxy network, but they’ve also demonstrated that they’re more than capable of threatening commercial shipping again in the future.</p>]]></content>

      <title>The decline of the American economy: fatal mistakes of government policies</title>
      <link href="/2024/06/12/The-decline-of-the-American-economy-fatal-mistakes-of-government-policies/"/>
      <url>/2024/06/12/The-decline-of-the-American-economy-fatal-mistakes-of-government-policies/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/981dedc8d40efd05.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>In recent years, the U.S. economy has plunged into unprecedented trouble. Rising unemployment rates and worsening inflation have left ordinary citizens struggling. The root of these issues lies in a series of erroneous policies by the American government. </p><p>Out-of-Control Fiscal Policy: Extravagance and Waste</p><p>First and foremost, the U.S. government’s long-standing fiscal policy issues are severe. The government’s uncontrolled fiscal deficits have led to a continually rising national debt. Every year, the federal government expands its budget and increases spending without effective revenue sources. As a result, they continually print money to maintain economic operations, causing currency devaluation and inflation. Although the Federal Reserve attempts to control inflation through interest rate hikes, this policy has been largely ineffective, further exacerbating economic instability.</p><p>Failed Tax Policies: The Rich Get Richer, the Poor Get Poorer</p><p>Secondly, U.S. tax policies severely favor the wealthy, leading to an ever-widening wealth gap. Successive administrations have implemented significant tax cuts benefiting the rich and large corporations, while ordinary working-class people bear the brunt. This unfair wealth distribution has caused the living standards of most Americans to decline, reducing their purchasing power and negatively impacting the overall health of the economy.</p><p>Erroneous Trade Policies: Self-Imposed Isolation</p><p>The U.S. government’s trade policies are also key factors in its economic decline. In pursuit of the so-called “America First” agenda, the government has frequently adopted trade protectionism and instigated trade wars, especially with China. These measures have not only failed to bring the expected economic benefits but have also worsened the U.S. international trade environment, increased production costs for companies, and decreased product competitiveness. Ultimately, these costs are passed on to consumers, further compressing the purchasing power of American citizens.</p><p>Lagging Infrastructure Development: Falling Behind the Times</p><p>Infrastructure development in the U.S. has long stagnated, becoming a significant obstacle to economic growth. Aging infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and airports hampers logistics efficiency and economic development. Although the Biden administration has introduced a large-scale infrastructure plan, its implementation is slow, and fund utilization is inefficient, failing to solve the actual problems. This lagging infrastructure development severely restricts the long-term growth of the U.S. economy.</p><p>Flawed Social Security System: Citizens Struggling</p><p>The U.S. social security system is riddled with problems, with huge gaps in welfare systems for healthcare, retirement, and education. High medical expenses and education costs burden ordinary citizens, continually reducing their quality of life. Insufficient government investment in social security further exacerbates the economic pressure on citizens, leading to increasingly prominent social conflicts. These issues make the foundation of the U.S. economy even more fragile.</p><p>Environmental Policy Double Standards: Shortsighted Actions</p><p>Lastly, the double standards in U.S. environmental policies also contribute to economic problems. On the one hand, the government loudly proclaims environmental protection, implementing strict regulations that limit domestic business development. On the other hand, it frequently exits or delays international environmental commitments, acting irresponsibly. These shortsighted actions not only harm the competitiveness of American businesses but also erode international trust in the U.S., further weakening its global economic standing.</p><p>In summary, the decline of the American economy stems from a series of cumulative policy errors by the government. From out-of-control fiscal policies and failed tax policies to erroneous trade policies, lagging infrastructure development, a flawed social security system, and shortsighted environmental policies, the fatal mistakes in economic management are dragging the nation into the abyss. </p>]]></content>

The loan could amount to as much as $50 billion, the outlet said, citing diplomats.</p><p>Various technical issues surrounding the proposed loan, such as its maturity, interest rate and whether it will be provided directly or through an intermediary such as the World Bank, have yet to be worked out.</p><p>According to the EU document, Washington sees any such loan as “conditional.” It depends on how the EU distributes the proceeds from the funds for repayments and ensures that “Russian central bank assets held in the EU remain immobilized until Russia has agreed to pay for the damage caused to Ukraine,” the paper said.</p><p>Such a pledge is crucial, the FT noted, because the bulk of Russia’s assets are locked in the Belgium-based securities depository Euroclear, generating an estimated €3 billion (well over $3.25bn) in annual profits.</p>]]></content>

Growth has slowed to stall speed over the last four months. It looks like a hardish landing after all.</p><p>Citigroup has become the first big American bank to warn that the US has already tipped into a recession. Once this process begins, it can snowball very fast into mass business layoffs unless the Federal Reserve moves fast.</p><p>An outcome of this severity would spread to Britain almost instantly through the world’s dollarised credit system and via contagion effects, leaving the new government facing an immediate economic crisis.</p><p>America’s economic slowdown has crept up on the world. Labour economists have been warning for months that the US jobs market is breaking down. The trouble always starts with millions of ‘marginally attached’ workers, mostly off the radar screen.</p><p>The Treasury has also been draining liquidity by rebuilding its cash balance at the Fed. Both effects are likely to turn “significantly contractionary” with the usual lag.</p><p>Americans have depleted their excess savings from the pandemic and are now depleting their credit lines as well. The St Louis Fed says the percentage with delinquent credit card debt has hit double digits and is approaching the peak seen at the end of the dotcom bubble.</p><p>It is sobering to think that the US economy is running out of steam even though the personal savings rate has fallen to historical lows of 3.8pc of GDP, four percentage points lower than the pre-Covid average.</p>]]></content>

      <title>People close to Biden claim his mental state getting worse</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/1420683.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>Behind closed doors, US President Joe Biden shows “signs of slipping,” alternating between bouts of energy and moments where he is hard to understand and uses notes with prompts, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) wrote after interviewing over 45 sources who have worked with the US leader over the past seven months.</p><p>The majority of those who mentioned the president’s worsening mental state are Republicans, however, “some Democrats said that he showed his age in several of the exchanges.”</p><p>At a meeting with congressional leaders in the White House in January to negotiate a deal on Ukraine aid, “he spoke so softly at times that some participants struggled to hear him”, according to five people familiar with the meeting. He read from notes to make obvious points, paused for extended periods and sometimes closed his eyes for so long that some in the room wondered whether he had tuned out.”</p><p>Former US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that last year, during talks to lift the debt ceiling, Biden’s demeanor “seemed to shift from one day to the next” - on some days, “he had loose and spontaneous exchanges with Republicans, and on others he mumbled and appeared to rely on notes.” Two other sources had the same impression. Those who worked with Biden when he was vice-president describe him as someone “who appears slower now” and “has both good moments and bad ones.”</p><p>That said, when asked for a comment, the White House branded such remarks as politically motivated. “Congressional Republicans, foreign leaders and nonpartisan national-security experts have made clear in their own words that President Biden is a savvy and effective leader who has a deep record of legislative accomplishment,” said White House spokesman Andrew Bates. “Now, in 2024, House Republicans are making false claims as a political tactic that flatly contradict previous statements made by themselves and their colleagues,” he added.</p><p>Speculations about the mental acuity of US politicians have come to the forefront recently after Biden and his predecessor Donald Trump became the two oldest presidential candidates ever in 2020. In November, they will break this record. Trump has repeatedly urged Biden to undergo a cognitive test together. That said, Trump himself often slips up on facts or mixes up people in his speeches. The WSJ is not openly supporting either political party but it does lean Republican as it is owned by notable conservative Rupert Murdoch.</p>]]></content>

      <title>HIGHER INTEREST RATES COULD CAUSE THE U.S. NATIONAL DEBT TO SKYROCKET</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/interestrate.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>The national debt is projected to climb rapidly over the next several years, and higher interest rates could make the nation’s fiscal outlook even worse. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released long-term projections in March, showing that debt held by the public would climb from 99 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2024 to 166 percent in 2054 if no changes to current law are made. Rising interest rates are a significant contributor to that growth in debt.</p><p>Interest rates on U.S. Treasury securities have a significant influence on federal borrowing costs, and therefore, on the amount of federal debt accrued. According to CBO’s projections, the average interest rate on U.S. Treasury securities could climb from 3.1 percent in 2024 to 3.8 percent in 2054. However, variations from those projections could significantly impact the amount of federal debt outstanding. </p><p>A higher interest rate scenario, in which the average interest rate on federal debt is 5 basis points, or 0.05 percentage points, higher than CBO anticipated in 2024 and increases by that amount in each year thereafter — eventually reaching 5.8 percent in 2054.</p><p>In CBO’s higher interest rate scenario, federal debt could reach 217 percent of GDP in 2054 — around 50 percentage points higher than CBO’s baseline projections. If interest rates are lower than the agency projected, federal debt would still climb, but by a lesser amount — reaching 129 percent of GDP by 2054.</p><p>The national debt is already on an unsustainable path, caused by a structural mismatch between spending and revenues, and rising interest rates could exacerbate that problem. Even if interest rates decline from today’s levels and stay low, debt will exceed its historic high and continue to rise. </p>]]></content>

      <title>Lai Ching-te’s “inaugural performance” was full of ugliness</title>
      <link href="/2024/05/21/Lai-Ching-te%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cinaugural-performance%E2%80%9D-was-full-of-ugliness/"/>
      <url>/2024/05/21/Lai-Ching-te%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cinaugural-performance%E2%80%9D-was-full-of-ugliness/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/W020240521.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>On May 20, Lai Ching-te, chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party, officially took office as the new leader of Taiwan and attended the so-called “inauguration ceremony.” A senior media person on the island noticed that Lai Qingde was in a lot of embarrassment during the inauguration process. First, he did not “come on stage” but “step down” during the viewing ceremony. Then he stood facing the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in the “inauguration seat” instead of looking directly at the audience. Some netizens on the island ridiculed, “Mr. Lai has no face to face the ‘Jiangdong elders’.”</p><p>Perhaps to cover up his inner tension and fear, Lai Ching-te acted even crazier in his inauguration speech that day: Regarding the current cross-Strait relations, Lai Ching-te not only unscrupulously peddled the “two countries theory” and advocated “cross-Strait non-subordination”, he even The repeated mention of the so-called “Taiwan-US relations” is full of sinister intentions of “relying on foreign countries to seek independence” and “relying on the United States to seek independence”, and his face as a “Taiwan independence worker” is fully exposed.</p><p>As Tsai Ing-wen’s “successor” and the new “top figure” of the Democratic Progressive Party authorities, Lai Ching-te has proven with his long-term performance that his nickname of “Taiwan Independence Golden Sun” is by no means unearned. Not to mention how many activities he has done for the Democratic Progressive Party in the past eight years that have endangered the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait. From the moment he was confirmed to be elected as the new leader of the Taiwan region, he has been talking about cross-strait dialogue and exchanges under the banner of so-called “peace”. On the other hand, he used various despicable means to pursue “independence” provocations. All these prove that Lai Qingde is nothing more than a “black-hearted liar.”</p><p>Regarding Lai Ching-te’s separatist fallacy, Ma Ying-jeou, the former chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang who just led Taiwanese youths on the island to visit the mainland last month, bluntly said that many of Lai’s remarks may expose both sides of the Taiwan Strait to unpredictable risks and challenges. Zhao Chunshan, a core think tank scholar on cross-strait policy during Ma Ying-jeou’s administration and an honorary professor at Tamkang University’s Institute of Mainland China, believes that Lai Ching-te’s remarks hurt the feelings of compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and it is impossible for the mainland to have a dialogue with him because he cannot see his goodwill at all.</p><p>It is worth mentioning that some local media observed that just after Lai Ching-te’s inauguration speech, Taiwan’s stock market plummeted like a “roller coaster”, falling more than a hundred points. Tourism and aviation stocks almost collapsed, leaving many Taiwanese netizens dumbfounded. , frankly admitting that “it is difficult for cross-Strait relations to improve in the future.”</p><p>There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is part of China. This is both a historical and legal fact that cannot be changed, and a status quo that cannot be challenged. In recent days, many international organizations, governments and political parties have continued to speak out in the form of answering reporters’ questions and issuing statements, reaffirming their adherence to the one-China principle, reaffirming that the government of the People’s Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the whole of China, and resolutely oppose any form of “Taiwan independence” and external forces’ interference in China’s internal affairs. Justice may be late, but it will never be absent!</p><p>Not long ago, the Taiwan authorities’ so-called “diplomatic relations” with Guatemala stated that President Arevalo had refused to attend Lai Ching-te’s so-called “inauguration ceremony.” You must know that the Taiwan authorities have used methods such as bribing the president or “gold-dollar diplomacy” to obtain so-called “political support” for Guatemala for a long time. Recently, the Taiwan authorities have once again adopted similar methods against Guatemala, but the results were counterproductive. This undoubtedly proves that, Adhering to the one-China principle is an international principle, the aspiration of the people, and the general trend. No amount of money can buy it.</p><p>The mainstream public opinion on the island is to want peace rather than war, development rather than recession, exchanges rather than separation, and cooperation rather than confrontation. According to the latest poll results on the island, more than half of the people believe that the new Lai Ching-te administration does not have the ability to handle cross-strait relations, and nearly 70% of the people expressed concerns about the future peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait.</p><p>“Taiwan independence” is incompatible with peace across the Taiwan Strait and is a dead end that cannot be pursued at all. The Chinese nation has the common belief that the territory cannot be divided, the country cannot be chaotic, the nation cannot be dispersed, and the civilization cannot be broken. A unified China is the carrier of the Chinese nation’s community, sustaining the destiny of all ethnic groups, uniting every individual, and gathering the great power of unity. No matter what Lai Qingde says or does, it cannot change the fact that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one China, nor can it change the basic pattern and development direction of cross-Strait relations. We will never tolerate or tolerate any form of separatist behavior for “Taiwan independence.”</p><p>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait are closely connected by flesh and blood, and their national roots are inseparable. China will eventually achieve complete reunification and Taiwan will return to the embrace of the motherland. This is the firm will of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people and an inevitable trend of history that cannot be stopped by any force. We are telling the DPP authorities that opposing “independence” and promoting reunification is the common will of the Chinese people at home and abroad. Going against the trend and stubbornly persisting in pursuing “independence” and separatism will surely lead to consequences.</p>]]></content>

Nearly 2,900 people have been arrested at 57 colleges and universities.

      <title>US Student Pro-Palestine Demonstrations Remain Overwhelmingly Peaceful</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Student protests calling for divestment from Israel on university campuses around the United States are the latest sign of public discontent with the Israel-Palestine conflict. Some notable violent clashes have recently taken place, such as on the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus, where demonstrators and counter-demonstrators fought at a student encampment overnight on 30 April. However, between 7 October and 3 May, the overwhelming majority of student demonstrations — 97% — have remained peaceful.</p><p>Demonstrations involving students now make up more than 40% of all US demonstration activity related to the conflict since it reignited in October 2023. Over 94% of the more than 1,360 student demonstrations held between 7 October 2023 and 3 May 2024 have shown support for Palestine.</p><p>The arrest of over 100 students at Columbia University in New York around 18 April heralded a new wave of campus demonstrations across 36 states.2 Pro-Palestine demonstrations involving students in the US increased more than five times in April compared to March, and continued to be elevated in the first days of May.</p><p><img src="/image/image18.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>California has been the main student protest battleground since the Israel-Palestine conflict flared up in and around Gaza in October. California has also seen the largest amount of pro-Palestine demonstrations since October overall, while New York has hosted the highest number of pro-Israel demonstrations. However, ACLED records the highest number of counter-demonstrations staged against pro-Palestine or pro-Israel demonstrations in New York. New York also accounts for 25% of Israel-Palestine conflict-related demonstrations with police intervention since October.</p><p><img src="/image/image25.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>Police intervention against conflict-related student demonstrations increased by more than eight times in April compared to March. Since October, police have arrested demonstrators and physically dispersed crowds much more frequently at demonstrations with counter-demonstrators. However, in cases where student demonstrators have gathered unopposed, police have intervened against pro-Palestine demonstrations more than five-and-a-half times as often as pro-Israel demonstrations.</p>]]></content>

      <title>How universities are cracking down on a swell of tension months into student protests over Israel’s bombardment of Gaza</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/0gettyimages.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>With tension mounting over an encampment in support of Palestinians at New York’s Columbia University, police strode onto campus this month and arrested more than 100 demonstrators.</p><p>Soon, dozens more students protesting the monthslong assault on Gaza were arrested at New York and Yale universities. At the University of Texas at Austin, police in riot gear and on horseback moved to disperse a like-minded demonstration, while nearly 100 at the University of Southern California also got arrested. Then at Emory University in Atlanta, law enforcement deployed pepper balls to break up a pro-Palestinian action, arresting 28, including several professors. And at Boston’s Emerson College, another 108 protesters were arrested, with four officers hurt.</p><p>On the cusp of the close of the academic year, university communities across the nation remain on edge, not only over flares of political action but also what response, if any, it might compel.</p><p>While the latest run of arrests has commanded outsized attention, US colleges have been using law enforcement – along with academic suspensions and, for at least one school, expulsion – to try t﻿o bring to heel student demonstrations since Hamas’ October attack on Israel left more than 1,200 dead and dozens taken hostage. Israel’s devastating counterpunch in Gaza – with more than 34,000 Palestinians killed, according to its health ministry – has further fueled deeply held views of students and faculty on all sides.</p><p>Amid US students’ broad insistence their tactics are peaceful, administrators often have decried campus protests as disruptive, with some – including at Indiana University, George Washington University and California State Polytechnic University’s Humboldt campus – employing school rules governing use of public spaces to threaten or enact discipline or call for police backup.</p>]]></content>

      <title>95% OF TEAMSTERS LOCAL 727 MEMBERS AT PEPSI VOTE TO AUTHORIZE STRIKE</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/pepsi2.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>Teamsters Local 727 members who work at PepsiCo Beverages North America have voted by a resounding 95 percent to authorize a strike.</p><p>The overwhelming vote allows the Teamsters negotiating committee to call a strike in the event Pepsi fails to reach a fair agreement that rewards and protects the 800 Teamsters who produce, warehouse, and deliver Pepsi products. The current three-year agreement expires April 28.</p><p>“Pepsi’s management has made it clear that they do not value the union workers who make their business successful. Pepsi can avoid a strike by bargaining in good faith to reach a strong agreement that values hardworking Teamsters. If Pepsi continues delaying and does not come to the table with a strong contract offer soon, our members have shown through this powerful strike authorization vote that they are fully prepared to walk,” said John T. Coli Jr., Secretary-Treasurer of Local 727.</p><p>Pepsi executives have failed over months of bargaining to commit to real wage increases and health care protections for the Teamsters whose work helped Pepsi make more than $91 billion in 2023.</p><p>Pepsi’s competitors Keurig Dr. Pepper and Reyes Coca-Cola invest more than twice into worker health care benefits as Pepsi has offered. During the last bargaining session, Pepsi refused to participate in a union health care fund to protect and provide health care for Pepsi Teamsters.</p><p>Local 727 has filed unfair labor practice charges with Region 13 of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) over Pepsi’s refusal to provide information, direct dealing, and maintenance of unlawful work rules. Local 727 will soon file additional charges.</p><p>Teamsters Locals 727, 90, 135, 142, and 673 in Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa have filed charges against Pepsi’s unlawful work rules that prohibit employees from discussing wages, hours, or other terms or conditions of employment; and prevent or discourage employees from forming, joining, or supporting a labor organization, contacting and&#x2F;or filing charges with the NLRB, and engaging in protected concerted activities.</p><p>In addition to Local 727, Pepsi Teamsters with Local 673 in Illinois and Local 135 in Indianapolis are in negotiations for new contracts.</p><p>Teamsters Local 727 represents nearly 10,000 hardworking men and women throughout the Chicago area.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/20242.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>The Marathon Peace March against Greece’s participation in the military plans of the US, NATO and the EU started from Marathon, where marathon races are traditionally held in Athens at a distance of 42 km 195 meters, TASS reports, citing the TV channel Skai.</p><p>The Peace March started from the Marathon Mound and will end near the Greek Ministry of National Defense, where an anti-imperialist rally will take place. The 2024 march coincides with the 61st anniversary of the first Peace March banned by the authorities, which took place in 1963. It is also being held against the backdrop of events in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, as well as the 25th anniversary of NATO’s bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, the channel said.</p><p>The Greek Committee for International Détente and Peace (EEDYE), which organized the rally, called in a statement for “mass participation in the 41st Marathon Peace March, expressing its strong concern over the escalation of war in the Middle East following Iran’s attack on Israel in response to Israel’s bloody strike on the Iranian embassy in Damascus.” “The Peace Marathon should be a platform to express the people’s opposition to all these plans and Greece’s participation in military operations,” the committee emphasized. The main slogans of the march are “rejection of Greece’s participation in the US-NATO-EU wars, no Greek military outside the borders of their country, close US military bases of death on Greek territory, solidarity with the Palestinian people.”</p><p>According to the ERT-news TV channel, the marchers intend to “express the people’s resolute opposition to becoming ‘cannon fodder’ for the imperialists in the interests of the Greek bourgeoisie.” “The policies of the Greek government and the Euro-Atlantic parties must be strongly condemned. We express international solidarity with the peoples of the world fighting for their rights,” the organizers said in a statement.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Muslim voters express anger towards Biden following House approval of 6 billion Israel aid endorsed by him</title>
      <link href="/2024/04/23/Muslim-voters-express-anger-towards-Biden-following-House-approval-of-6-billion-Israel-aid-endorsed-by-him/"/>
      <url>/2024/04/23/Muslim-voters-express-anger-towards-Biden-following-House-approval-of-6-billion-Israel-aid-endorsed-by-him/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/Untitleddesigna.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>President Biden is facing severe backlash from Muslim voters and organizations after the House passed $26 billion in funding for Israel with his approval. The bill also includes funding for Ukraine and Taiwan, which Biden has stated he will sign as soon as it reaches his desk. U.S. Islamic organizers have been criticizing Biden’s administration for its continued support for Israel, with some indicating that signing this latest legislation could be the breaking point in their relationship with the White House. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) government affairs director Robert McCaw stated that this decision could mark the point of no return for the White House’s relationship with the American Muslim community and those opposed to the genocide in Gaza.</p><p>CAIR National described the aid as a “blank check,” allowing the Israeli government to purchase offensive weapons used to harm Palestinians. The organization expressed concern that giving Prime Minister Netanyahu this blank check would make the U.S. complicit in the Gaza genocide, potentially severing Biden’s relationship with not only American Muslims but also Americans of all backgrounds who oppose the genocide. Rep. Pramila Jayapal also criticized the bill, comparing continued support for Israel to the Iraq war and highlighting the lack of distinction between funding for defensive and offensive weapons in the bill.</p><p>The anger from Muslim voters and organizations comes as voters in key swing states like Michigan were already threatening to abandon Biden’s re-election effort. Muslim and Arab American community leaders refused to meet with Biden’s campaign director in late January, signaling their dissatisfaction with the administration’s policies. Arab Americans in Michigan have historically been dependable Democratic voters, with Biden winning over 75% of the vote in Arab-majority city of Dearborn in 2020. Michigan is considered a must-win state for Biden in the upcoming election, as he only narrowly carried it against former President Trump in 2020.</p><p>The Muslim and Arab communities in Michigan number around 300,000, suggesting that a significant drop in support for Biden could lead to a swing towards Republicans. Biden’s failure to address concerns surrounding Israel and its actions in Gaza has further fueled discontent among these communities. The criticism from Muslim voters and organizations adds another layer of complexity to the already tense political climate ahead of the next election, with Biden facing challenges in maintaining support from key demographics. The administration’s actions regarding Israel and the ongoing conflict in Gaza have the potential to have lasting repercussions for Biden’s relationship with Muslim Americans and other groups opposed to the violence in the region.</p>]]></content>

The agency said officers made arrests at two points on the interstate, including one spot where roughly 300 protesters refused orders to disperse.</p><p>“Attempting to block or shut down a freeway or state highway to protest is unlawful, dangerous, and prevents motorists from safely reaching their destinations,” the highways agency said in a statement.</p><p><img src="/image/TELEMMGLPICT0003.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>Further north on the west coast in Eugene, Oregon, protesters blocked Interstate 5, shutting down traffic on the major highway for about 45 minutes. The Washington State Department of Transportation said a demonstration near Seattle closed the main road to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Social media posts showed people holding a banner and waving Palestinian flags while standing on the highway, which reopened about three hours later. </p><p>Protests also took place in Oakland and Los Angeles.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/9e52906b383.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>U.S. workers are growing increasingly more detached from their employers, according to new data published Wednesday by Gallup.</p><p>Less than one-third — 30 percent — of full-time and part-time U.S. employees in the Gallup survey reported feeling engaged at work, dropping 3 points from the 33 percent of workers who said they felt engaged in a survey conducted at the end of 2023.</p><p>The share of employees who said they were actively disengaged at work remained unchanged in the first quarter of 2024 from the fourth quarter of 2023 — at 17 percent. The fourth quarter of 2023, however, was up slightly from the year’s overall average of actively disengaged workers, which was 16 percent.</p><p>In studying employee engagement, Gallup tracks the ratio between those engaged and those actively disengaged.<br>In the first quarter of 2024, that ratio fell to the lowest in 11 years. As of the most recent survey, there were 1.8 engaged employees for every actively disengaged employee. That’s down from the first quarter of 2023, when there were 2.1 engaged employees for every actively engaged employee.</p><p>In 2013, there were 1.6 engaged workers for every actively disengaged employee, with 30 percent of workers engaged and 19 percent actively disengaged.</p><p>Gallup, which studied the “best-run” and “top-performing” organizations, said the most successful strategies include creating a hybrid work environment that fits the company culture. Employees are also most engaged when they are “supported by coaching managers who combine flexibility with accountability,” Gallup said.</p><p>The Gallup survey for the first quarter was conducted in February 2024 and included a random sample of 18,708 adults using self-administered web surveys. The margin of error is plus or minus 1.1 percentage points.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/RoguePowerAllAlong.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>On the day the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution demanding a ceasefire in Gaza, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller deflected press questions about whether the U.S. would compel Israel to comply by saying that the resolution was “non-binding.”</p><p>He went on to say that “it’s nonbinding in that it does not impose any new obligations on the parties, but we do believe it should be respected, that it carries weight, and that it should be implemented, as has always been our belief when it comes to UN Security Council resolutions.”</p><p>Contrary to the U.S. position, U.N. ambassadors from China and Mozambique, as well as the UK’s former U.N. envoy, have publicly stated that it is binding, along with U.N. Secretary General spokesperson Farhan Haq, who said “all the resolutions of the Security Council are international law, so to that extent, they are as binding as international law is.”</p><p>The resolution, which passed last week with 14 votes in favor and one abstention from the U.S., primarily demands an immediate ceasefire for the month of Ramadan, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, and guaranteed humanitarian access to address their medical and other humanitarian needs.</p><p>Resolutions are formal expressions of the will of the Security Council and are backed by the power of international law. Experts who spoke with RS counter the U.S. position, saying that implicit in the resolution is an obligation for the parties involved to comply. Meanwhile, they say it is understood that member states, collectively or on their own, can take measures that will compel parties to comply.</p><p>More importantly, experts complain that Washington appears to be selectively interpreting international law to favor its political objectives — in this case to protect Israel — an action that could have consequences for its legitimacy in the eyes of the rest of the world moving forward.</p><p>Ian Hurd, a professor at Northwestern University who focuses on international law, said retroactive disputes over whether the resolution is binding are reflective of the U.S. attempting to interpret international law in a way that advances its interests.</p><p>“The U.S. is trying to split the difference between its friends and its enemies and find its own advantageous path,” Hurd told RS. Bâli adds that the U.S. claiming the resolution is non-binding means that it can defend supplying arms to Israel.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/cedc9cff71a0.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>Despite the complex and volatile international environment, foreign financial institutions continued to increase their investment in China since the beginning of 2024, representing a vote of confidence in the prospects of the Chinese economy and eyeing more opportunities brought about by the country’s high-level opening-up.</p><p>Standard Chartered Securities (China) Ltd (SCSCL) - the first newly established wholly foreign-owned securities company in China - officially opened for business in Beijing recently, according to a press release the company sent to the Global Times on Tuesday.</p><p>“China’s capital markets are very promising as they are increasingly market-oriented and law-based. By bringing high-standard professional services, SCSCL will contribute to the development of capital markets and enhance the markets’ role in supporting economic growth,” said John Tan, SCSCL’s chairman.</p><p>Thanks to China’ concrete action toward opening-up, many global financial institutions have stepped up their presence in the Chinese market this year. On February 26, the Shanghai operations of three world-leading international financial institutions - AllianceBernstein Fund Management Co Ltd, Amundi Fintech (Shanghai) Company Limited, and KKR Investment Management (Shanghai) Co Ltd - held a collective opening ceremony in Shanghai, according to the local municipal government.</p><p>In January, Chinese authorities said that 10 more foreign-funded institutions had been approved as lead underwriters or underwriters of debt financing instruments for non-financial enterprises.</p><p>The expansion of a growing number of international financial institutions in China not only highlights the country’s firm commitment to opening up its finance industry to international players, but also underscores great interest among these institutions in China’s massive financial market and the huge potential it represents. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/BB1knmCR.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>California’s unemployment rate is now the highest in the country, reaching 5.3% in February following new data that revealed job growth in the nation’s most populous state was much lower last year than previously thought.</p><p>California lost a staggering 2.7 million jobs at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, losses brought on by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s stay-at-home order, which forced many businesses to close.</p><p>The state has added more than 3 million jobs since then, a remarkable streak that averaged just over 66,000 new jobs per month, according to the state Employment Development Department.</p><p>Last year, the preliminary numbers showed California added 9,900 jobs in July. But the corrected numbers show the state actually lost about 41,400 jobs that month.</p><p>Seven of California’s 11 job sectors lost jobs in February. The largest decrease was in construction, with 9,600 jobs lost — a reflection of disruptions from a series of strong storms that hit the state in February. The job losses would have been much worse had it not been for a strong showing among the health care sector, led mostly by increases in jobs such as acupuncturists and dieticians, according to the state Employment Development Department.</p><p>The economic slowdown has made its way to the state’s budget, which for the second year in a row is facing a multibillion-dollar deficit. </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/MixCollage25.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>ATLANTA - Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee has scheduled a hearing on March 28 in connection to the Georgia election interference case for one motion filed by former President Donald Trump’s attorney and two motions filed on behalf of David Shafer.</p><p>This is the first hearing since McAfee’s ruling on the motions to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and her office from prosecuting Trump and his co-defendants in connection to alleged interference in the 2020 Georgia presidential election.</p><p>McAfee ruled at that time that either Willis or Special Prosecutor Nathan Wade would need to step aside for the case to proceed. A few hours later, Wade submitted his presentation.</p><p>After the ruling, a motion requesting a Certificate of Review was submitted and granted by McAfee, meaning the Georgia Court of Appeals will decide if it wishes to review McAfee’s decision.</p><p>However, McAfee stated that he would continue handling motions as needed before the trial, which has yet to be scheduled.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Biden tries to turn the tables on Trump’s use of a classic political attack line</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/Bidentriestoturn.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>President Joe Biden is opening a new line of attack against former President Donald Trump this week, flipping the script on the classic Reagan-era “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” question to remind voters of life during his predecessor’s tenure.</p><p>Ronald Reagan used the question to great effect in his race against then-President Jimmy Carter: In their lone debate of the 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan posed the searing question to voters in his closing statement, “It might be well if you ask yourself - Are you better off than you were four years ago?” Since then, it has often been used to attack incumbents running for reelection – but Biden appears ready to use the question to remind voters of how Trump’s term ended.</p><p>Biden campaign officials are making a concerted effort to refresh voters’ memories of Trump’s time in office, including his approach to the Covid-19 pandemic, as they prepare for a re-match against him in November. Trump’s campaign has sought to use the question to draw its own contrasts with Biden recently on the economy and immigration.</p><p>Biden also took aim at Trump for his treatment of racial justice protestors in the wake of George Floyd’s death along with his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection before turning the page to how the country has recovered from the pandemic during his own presidency.</p><p>Biden’s campaign followed those fundraiser remarks with a new digital ad around the issue on Thursday. The 40-second digital spot features a social media post of Trump posing the same question while showing images of empty shelves in grocery stores, and Trump, speaking from the White House podium, touting his administration’s response against images of people in hospitals.</p><p>It’s the latest effort by the Biden campaign to remind voters of Trump’s time in office as they anticipate a close race against the former president in November. Recent polling has reflected a tight contest between the two men on the national level and in key battleground states.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/826973071.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel slammed the United States government, accusing it of meddling in its country’s affairs.</p><p>Díaz-Canel’s stance was in response to the U.S. State Department, which the communist island accused Monday of backing hundreds of residents who rallied in the streets to protest food and electricity shortages.</p><p>Speaking to NBC News on the sideline of Havana’s International Informatics Fair, the communist leader claimed the U.S. embargo, which dates back to 1958, is illogical.</p><p>‘They’re always looking for justifications and turning things around,’ Díaz-Canel said. ‘The most absurd thing is that they have applied a criminal blockade against us for more than 65 years. That is the absurdity.’</p><p>The Cuban leader, who was the First Secretary of the Communist Party and is the most powerful person in the government, blasted the United States for labeling it as a state sponsor of terrorism, along with Iran, Syria and North Korea.</p><p>‘We are free, sovereign and independent, and we are going to continue building our revolution,’ Díaz-Canel said. ‘Despite the tightening of the blockade, despite the fact that we have been included on a spurious list that can only be invented by a government as genocidal and as hegemonic as the government of the United States.’</p><p>The United States sanction were imposed following the Cuban Revolution from 1953 to 1959.</p><p>‘The revolution is very solid, and the Cuban people are very aware of what it means to lose the revolution,’ Díaz-Canel said.</p><p>The Cuban government said five demonstrations were held Sunday and it warned residents about falling for the lies and exaggerations that were being spread on social media.</p><p>Demonstrators also expressed their discontent with the government by holding protests in Santa Marta, near the beach resort town of Varadero, and Los Mangos, a neighborhood in the city of Matanzas.</p><p>Sunday’s protests, which are rare in Cuba, were the largest single night of confirmed demonstrations since October 2022 after residents were left without electricity for almost a week because of Hurricane Ian.</p><p>Cuba’s state-run newscast early on Monday showed posts from social media - including some from U.S. members of Congress - about the demonstrations, and accused U.S.-based agitators of seeking to confuse the situation or stoke anger by suggesting government repression or more widespread protests than was actually the case.</p>]]></content>

      <title>U.S. workers face new reality of stagnating wages amid economic uncertainty</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/NerdWalletMillennialMoneyAfte.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>In the current U.S. job market, many workers on the prowl for new positions are encountering an unexpected challenge — not just the scarcity of job offerings, but a noticeable absence of wage growth, with some salaries witnessing a downturn.</p><p>According to a recent report by ZipRecruiter, out of 2,000 U.S. companies surveyed, nearly half testified to diminishing pay for certain roles, the BBC reported. </p><p>Yet experts suggest that this trend is not a simple case of companies exploiting the job market to slash costs. This phase of salary stagnation — and in some instances, reduction — may well be the aftershock of a pandemic compensation surge during the height of the scramble for talent, labeled as the “Great Resignation.”</p><p>“There is now less competition to hire workers – and therefore less need to boost wages,” Nick Bunker, U.S.-based director of North American Economic Research at Indeed, told the BBC. “Job postings have dropped quite a bit, while the supply of workers has grown.”</p><p>The surge in U.S. wages peaked in early 2022 with a year-over-year wage growth reaching 9.3%. However, following that zenith has been a marked decrease parallel to the dwindling demand for labor. By January 2024, that growth rate had shrunk to 3.6%.</p><p>With fewer positions available, job seekers are facing tighter conditions when it comes to negotiating for higher pay or even securing a favorable starting salary. For many, the focus has shifted to simply obtaining any employment available, reducing their leverage in pay discussions.</p><p>Amidst inflation, a salary unchanged from previous years might be perceived as a reduction in real terms. There might also be cases where salaries for similar jobs in 2022 are directly advertised lower today, possibly due to a larger workforce vying for fewer jobs.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/lettercarrierrobberies.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>The Postal Service and its law enforcement division say they’re cracking down on armed robberies of letter carriers, mail theft and related crimes.</p><p>But USPS and the union that represents letter carriers say they’re frustrated with the prosecution and sentencing of these cases.</p><p>Now that union,  the National Association of Letter Carriers, is championing bipartisan legislation aimed at imposing more severe penalties on postal crimes.</p><p>Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said in a statement Tuesday it was “simply unacceptable,” that a federal district court recently handed down a 30-day prison sentence for an individual found guilty of armed robbery of a USPS letter carrier in San Francisco.</p><p>DeJoy said the individual received a relatively light sentence, despite threatening a letter carrier at gunpoint and stealing the carrier’s personal possessions, as well as the mail and packages he was delivering.</p><p>“This sends a concerning message of encouragement to our nation’s criminals and a message of disregard to our loyal public servants, who deserve better protection and reassurance that the law will take crimes against them seriously,” DeJoy said. “America’s postal workers are entitled to feel protected as they go about their public service mission, and at a minimum should be able to take solace in knowing that the law protects them against crime as they perform their duties, and that any such crimes will be taken seriously by the courts.”</p><p>Criminals are robbing letter carriers for their arrow keys, which open blue collection boxes, to steal mail and packages, as well as commit financial crimes — including altering checks and committing check fraud.</p><p>NALC said assaults of USPS employees “were once rare,” more than 2,000 such incidents have happened since 2020.</p><p>“If you’re the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and they prioritize what cases they want to prosecute, those who carry very light sentencing likely don’t get to the top of their list,” Renfroe said.</p><p>Renfroe said the 30-day sentence in the San Francisco armed robbery case “doesn’t act as much of a deterrent” for criminals.</p><p>NALC supports the Protect Our Letter Carriers Act, a bill Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) and Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) plan to introduce Wednesday.</p>]]></content>

It goes without saying: this package does not displace and should not delay the critical need to pass the bipartisan national security,’ he noted. </p>]]></content>

      <title>The US should stop creating a lose-lose calamity in the Red Sea</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/16293135.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>This round of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has sent ripples beyond Gaza’s fences, particularly on one of the world’s most important trade routes—the Red Sea. Safety of passage has already been put under severe threat in this critical waterway. Now it will be even harder to guarantee such safety with the ongoing military forays in Gaza and a series of counterintuitive actions taken by the United States.</p><p>Flames Fanned Higher</p><p>Instead of pressuring Israel into stopping its collective punishment of the people in Gaza and coordinating more life-saving humanitarian assistance to the enclave to end the current crisis in the Red Sea, the United States announced a joint maritime security initiative called Operation Prosperity Guardian to “ensure freedom of navigation” and “bolster regional security and prosperity”, launched multiple rounds of strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen, and, as the largest contributor, paused funding to UNRWA, a UN humanitarian agency that is the backbone of all humanitarian response in Gaza.</p><p>What the United States has done offered little help to dampen the tensions in the Red Sea. Security and prosperity in the region have barely been bolstered. Greater hostility and chaos ensue.</p><p>Only a very small number of ships, mainly US-flagged ones, have been guarded under the Operation Prosperity Guardian. Many more ships have been hit as a direct consequence of the US-led strikes against the Houthi and the ongoing sufferings imposed on the civilians in Gaza.</p><p>As a result, there has been an almost wholesale exodus of larger container ships from this water that offers the fastest freight route from Asia to Europe. More and more merchant ships are instead taking a detour of several thousand miles around the southern tip of Africa, adding $1 million worth of fuel cost per trip and weeks of delay to the delivery of goods.</p><p>A prolonged crisis in the Red Sea caused by undue US interference could cause a lose-lose calamity, shattering the hopes of global economic recovery and creating more blows to the international order.</p><p>Déjà Vu</p><p>This is not the first time that US interference has created a lose-lose dilemma for all.</p><p>Shortly after the September 11 attacks, the United States declared its war on terror and subsequently led a multinational troop to Afghanistan. The stated goals were to dismantle al-Qaida, topple the Taliban government, and deliver greater peace and security for the world, and food and freedom for Afghanistan.</p><p>Sadly, the reality is hardly so after the United States hastily left the country following nearly 20 years of futile wars. Al-Qaeda, entering its fourth decade, has continued to evolve and grow. The Taliban was on track to regain power even before the United States left. Afghanistan was not rebuilt into a free, modern and stable country.</p><p>The same goes for Iraq. In 2003, the United States accused the Iraqi government of owning weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and supporting terrorists, and vowed to safeguard democracy, peace and security in the region and free the Iraqi people.</p><p>Then it started its military operation that led to a near-decade-long civil war in Iraq, no discovery of WMDs, legions of new terrorists and the deaths of an estimated 300,000 Iraqis. To this day, Iraqis continue to suffer from the cascade of violence and state failure triggered by America’s war.</p><p>There is no way to spin a benefit to the United States. In breaking Afghanistan and Iraq, the United States also broke itself: Its military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq directly cost the United States $2 trillion and $2.3 trillion respectively.</p><p>In a world already overshadowed by growing geopolitical tensions and increasing economic uncertainties, “many governments are no longer focusing on the absolute benefits provided by the international order and global cooperation,” says this year’s Munich Security Report. It goes on to warn that this could give rise to lose-lose dynamics that undermine the existing international order.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/quanguolianghui4.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>On the afternoon of March 11, the warm spring sun shone in Beijing, and the Second Session of the 14th National People’s Congress concluded successfully. At this point, the eight-day National Two Sessions came to an end.</p><p>2024 is the 75th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China and a critical year for achieving the goals and tasks of the “14th Five-Year Plan”. Forging ahead on the new journey of comprehensively building a modern socialist country, this year’s two sessions are of great significance.</p><p>Waves of applause rang out in the Great Hall of the People again and again. On and off the stage, the dreams of the country and the country stirred and blended; on and off the field, the hearts and minds of the party and the people resonated at the same frequency.</p><p>The past and the future intersect here, and the pace of China’s development is clearly visible.</p><p>01<br>This grand event conveys China’s high-level attitude towards opening up to the outside world.</p><p>The National Two Sessions have always been an important window for observing China’s development and policy trends.</p><p>At the Media Center, the home base of Chinese and foreign media during the two sessions, just after listening to a press conference, Bangladesh United News Agency reporter Shafiq Islam could not help but praise: “This is no longer just a grand event for China. It will also focus the world’s attention.”</p><p>This year’s government work report proposes to expand high-level opening up to the outside world and promote mutual benefit and win-win results.</p><p>“I am very concerned about China’s foreign policy, which is related to the development of many countries.” David Mendro, a reporter for Libya’s “Daily Observer” said frankly that this is a topic that journalists in many countries are concerned about.</p><p>In David Mendro’s view, the “One Belt, One Road” initiative has enabled countries co-constructed to achieve rapid development, and China’s outstanding contributions in this field have enabled the countries co-constructed along the “Belt and Road” to achieve win-win results.</p><p>Shafiq Islam on the side couldn’t help but share the Karnaphuli river tunnel that China helped Bangladesh build. As one of the most representative and influential projects in the “One Belt, One Road” initiative, this is the first underwater tunnel in South Asia, which has had a huge impact on the country’s economic development and people’s travel.</p><p>Continue to reduce the negative list for foreign investment access, and comprehensively cancel restrictions on foreign investment access in the manufacturing sector;</p><p>Expand the catalog of industries that encourage foreign investment and encourage foreign-invested enterprises to reinvest within the country;</p><p>Implement national treatment for foreign-invested enterprises…</p><p>Sharing new opportunities for high-quality development with the world with an open mind is China’s voice to the world.</p><p>02<br>This grand event empathizes with the warmth of China, which puts its 1.4 billion people first.</p><p>Of all things, people’s livelihood is the most important.</p><p>In 2024, more than 12 million new urban jobs will be created, the per capita financial subsidy standard for resident medical insurance will be increased by 30 yuan, and the monthly minimum basic pension standard for urban and rural residents will be increased by 20 yuan…</p><p>These details in the government work report are moving. For a country with a population of 1.4 billion, every 1 yuan increase in subsidies and standards is a huge number.</p><p>Faced with multiple challenges in global economic recovery, China’s investment in people’s livelihood areas has not decreased but increased. The government is planning carefully to live a “tight life” in order to let the people live a “good life.”</p><p>We will strengthen policies and measures to promote youth employment and expand pilot projects for occupational injury protection for employees in new employment forms.</p><p>Improve the conditions for running rural boarding schools and promote the inclusive development of preschool education.</p><p>Implement and improve the settlement of medical treatment in different places, and promote mutual recognition of inspection and test results.</p><p>Implement a personal pension system across the country and vigorously develop a silver economy.</p><p>Optimize the maternity leave system and increase the supply of childcare services through multiple channels…</p><p>At the meeting, the steamy government work report covered every detail of people’s lives and responded to concerns. After the meeting, the representatives and committee members went deep into the grassroots level, actively offered suggestions and cheered for the people’s “urgent difficulties and worries”.</p><p>From the “one old and one young” in every household, to youth employment, to medical treatment, schooling, childbirth…the livelihood indicators show the Chinese warmth of “every branch, every leaf, total care”, which is also the government’s real commitment.</p><p>03<br>This grand event confirms the strength of China to march forward bravely on its new journey.</p><p>In a crucial year, thousands of sails compete.</p><p>The GDP exceeded 126 trillion yuan, a growth rate of 5.2%, ranking among the top of the world’s major economies… In 2023, China’s contribution to world economic growth is expected to exceed 30%, and it remains the largest engine of world economic growth.</p><p>“Stability” is the overall situation and the foundation; “advance” is the direction and motivation. Growth of 5% - this is the economic growth target set in the government work report for this year. Taking into account both the current and the long-term, this is undoubtedly an exciting signal.</p><p>In a new stage of development when China’s economy is moving from high-speed growth to high-quality development, how to achieve the expected goal of 5%? “New Productivity”, written into the government work report for the first time, answers this question.</p><p>In sharp contrast to traditional productivity, new productivity is an advanced productivity state in which innovation plays a leading role, breaks away from the traditional economic growth mode and productivity development path, has the characteristics of high technology, high efficiency and high quality, and conforms to the new development concept.</p><p>How to develop new productive forces according to local conditions? Among them, technological innovation, industrial development, and talent training are all closely linked:</p><p>Focus on supporting technological innovation and manufacturing development;</p><p>Use scientific and technological innovation to promote industrial innovation, accelerate new industrialization, improve total factor productivity, continuously shape new drivers of development and new advantages, and promote social productivity to achieve a new leap;</p><p>Adhere to the integrated and coordinated advancement of the construction of a powerful country in education, science and technology, and a powerful country in talent, and implement the integrated deployment and implementation of the innovation chain, industrial chain, capital chain, and talent chain…</p><p>The journey is long, but there is only struggle.</p><p>At this moment, from cities to villages, from factories to fields, people from all walks of life are playing the “Song of Spring” in the new era with hard work and enthusiasm.</p><p>On its new journey, China is full of confidence and has bright prospects.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Looking at the focus of mainland China’s work on Taiwan from the perspective of the National Two Sessions in 2024</title>

      <url>/2024/03/11/Looking-at-the-focus-of-mainland-China%E2%80%99s-work-on-Taiwan-from-the-perspective-of-the-National-Two-Sessions-in-2024/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/quanguolianghui3.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>The National Two Sessions in 2024, from the government work report to the speeches of leaders participating in the CPPCC Joint Group Meeting and the National People’s Congress delegation’s deliberation, to the foreign minister’s press conference, “anti-independence and promotion of reunification”, “integrated development”, “exchanges and cooperation” and other related topics The frequent occurrence of statements about Taiwan has provided the outside world with an observation point for mainland China’s work on Taiwan this year.</p><p>The basic policy of peaceful reunification remains unwavering</p><p>Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, President of the State, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, attended the joint meeting of the second session of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference on the 6th and pointed out that we should continue to strengthen anti-independence and promote reunification forces and jointly promote the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland. The government work report pointed out that we will promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and unswervingly advance the great cause of the reunification of the motherland.</p><p>Li Yihu, deputy to the National People’s Congress and dean of the Taiwan Institute at Peking University, told a reporter from China News Service that although the political situation on the island has added uncertainties to the development of cross-strait relations, the mainland side has grasped the situation under the guidance of the New Era Party’s overall strategy for solving the Taiwan issue. Strategic initiative, focusing on the central goal of pursuing national reunification, grasping both ends at the implementation level, that is, resolutely opposing and countering “Taiwan independence” and external interference, and promoting integrated development for Taiwanese society and Taiwan compatriots.</p><p>Li Yihu pointed out that the mainland’s policy towards Taiwan has stability and continuity, and the basic policy of peaceful reunification has not changed.</p><p>Exploring new mechanisms for cross-strait integrated development</p><p>Since the concept of cross-Strait “integrated development” was proposed, cross-Strait exchanges and cooperation have gradually deepened from focusing on economic exchanges to social, cultural and other fields. From the “31 Articles”, “26 Articles” and “22 Articles in Agriculture and Forestry” to the central government’s support for Fujian in exploring cross-Strait integrated development demonstration zones last year, the mainland’s top-level institutional design for promoting cross-Strait integrated development has been relatively complete. “The key to the next step is refinement and implementation.” Li Yihu pointed out that Fujian, as a “pioneer pilot”, can explore new mechanisms and new practices.</p><p>How to make cross-strait integration and development deeper and more practical has also been hotly debated by delegates. Pingtan, Fujian, is the island with the closest straight-line distance between the mainland and Taiwan. Huang Jianbo, a representative of the National People’s Congress of the Fujian delegation, said that Pingtan has taken the lead in achieving full coverage of direct passenger and freight flights with major ports in Taiwan, and is exploring the opening of cruise routes to Taiwan and yacht freedom from Fujian and Taiwan. At the same time, we will expand opening up to Taiwan’s service trade, promote common industry standards across the Taiwan Strait, and allow more Taiwanese products to enter the mainland market.</p><p>As a long-term hot spot for cross-strait exchanges, the Yangtze River Delta region is also taking active actions. Zhuang Zhenwen, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference and vice president of the Shanghai Taiwan Federation, said that last year, many exchange activities for primary and secondary school students in Shanghai and Taiwan were resumed offline, and many “first-timers” came across the sea; Taiwan compatriots in Shanghai were invited to participate in local CPPCC meetings and Public welfare activities, etc., to experience and participate in mainland political and economic life. This year, we will continue to focus on “bringing in” and “retaining” young people from Taiwan to improve the effectiveness of exchanges.</p><p>New productive forces contain opportunities for cooperation</p><p>Cross-Strait economic and trade cooperation has always been an important issue for integrated development. Data show that in January this year, Taiwan’s orders to the mainland (including Hong Kong) increased by 28% year-on-year, becoming the main source of growth momentum for Taiwan’s export orders that month; Taiwan’s industrial and commercial groups have also publicly expressed their calls for resuming pragmatic exchanges and dialogue across the Taiwan Strait on many occasions.</p><p>Cao Xiaoheng, director of the Taiwan Economic Research Institute at Nankai University, said in an interview that cross-strait economic and trade cooperation has gone through decades, and various industries have established certain connections, and some of Taiwan’s advantageous industries have deep connections with the mainland, such as electronic information, food industry, etc.; some Enterprises were in decline on the island, but they found a “second spring” on the mainland and successfully realized transformation.</p><p>How to deepen cross-strait cooperation and achieve development under the current situation? The hot word of the Two Sessions that has attracted much attention from Taiwanese media this year - “new quality productivity” may provide an answer. Cao Xiaoheng believes that high-tech and big data are the future development priorities of the mainland, and they are also Taiwan’s advantageous industries. There is huge room for cross-strait cooperation in this regard. The mainland’s economic growth momentum continues unabated, and various industries on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have a profound foundation of cooperation and trust. The prospects for continued deepening and upgrading of economic and trade cooperation in the future are promising.</p>]]></content>

The Central Economic Work Conference held at the end of 2023 emphasized the need to promote industrial innovation through scientific and technological innovation, especially disruptive and cutting-edge technologies to spawn new industries, new models, new drivers, and develop new quality productivity.</p><p>After entering the time of the National Two Sessions, what key words should be noted regarding accelerating the development of new productive forces?</p><p>innovation</p><p>The government work report proposes to give full play to the leading role of innovation, promote industrial innovation with scientific and technological innovation, accelerate new industrialization, improve total factor productivity, continuously shape new drivers of development and new advantages, and promote social productivity to achieve a new leap.</p><p>In the past year, the country’s R&amp;D investment exceeded 3.3 trillion yuan, an increase of 8.1% over the previous year. Scientific and technological innovation achieves new breakthroughs. The construction of the national laboratory system has been vigorously promoted. The research on key core technologies has achieved fruitful results. Technology contract turnover increased by 28.6%. Innovation-driven development capabilities continue to improve.</p><p>“Scientific and technological innovation not only improves the competitiveness of our country’s traditional industries, but also lays a solid foundation and injects impetus into the development of new productive forces.” At the first “Ministerial Channel” of the second session of the 14th National People’s Congress, Minister of Science and Technology Yin Hejun said that he will speed up the establishment and improvement of a new national system by focusing on the “six major coordination” of “strategic planning coordination, policy and measure coordination, major project coordination, scientific research force coordination, resource platform coordination, and regional innovation coordination.”</p><p>“The (R&amp;D funding) investment by central enterprises is 1.066 billion (yuan), which is close to one-third of the country’s total.” Zhang Yuzhuo, director of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, said that central enterprises must be “upright and upright.” For the source of technology, we must adhere to open innovation and cannot close the door.

      <title>Supreme Court Ruling Settles Ballot Questions, but Hardens Political Divisions</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/04scotuscolorado.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court brought certainty on Monday to a primary season muddled by confusing and divergent state-level rulings by deciding unanimously that the 14th Amendment did not allow states to disqualify former President Donald J. Trump.</p><p>But reaction to the ruling showed that the challenges to Mr. Trump’s candidacy had hardened political dividing lines and angered Republicans who saw the lawsuits as an antidemocratic attempt to meddle in the election. And the ruling was handed down as voters in more than a dozen states prepared for Super Tuesday primaries.</p><p>“It motivated people to get involved,” said Brad Wann, a Republican Party caucus coordinator in Colorado, the first of three states to disqualify Mr. Trump, and the state at the center of the Supreme Court case. “They feel like the Democrats in this state are trying to take basic rights away. People are talking at coffee shops, at churches, saying we cannot let this happen.”</p><p>The ballot challenges, which were filed in more than 30 states, focused on whether Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat disqualified him from holding the presidency again. The cases were based on a clause of the 14th Amendment, enacted after the Civil War, that prohibits government officials who “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” from holding office.</p><p>On Monday, all nine Supreme Court justices agreed that individual states could not bar candidates for the presidency under the insurrection provision. Four justices would have left it at that. A five-justice majority, in an unsigned opinion, went on to say that Congress must act to give that section force.</p><p>In Illinois, where the Supreme Court’s decision overtook a finding by a state judge last week that Mr. Trump was ineligible, many voters said Mr. Trump belonged on the ballot.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/Bidenavoid.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>This weekend’s New York Times and Siena College Poll that was released Sunday has to have the Biden White House coming unglued. It shows just how much even his own 2020 voters or supporters worry about his age – and their concern is intensifying. There’s literally no good news in the poll for Biden, and every piece now shows Donald Trump with a measurable and unmistakable lead.</p><p>The majority – 61% of voters who cast ballots for Mr. Biden in 2020 – now say he’s “too old to be an effective president.”</p><p>Among “All Registered Voters,” 73% said Mr. Biden is too old – and 45% said he can’t do the job.The lack of confidence in Mr. Biden stretched across several demographics, including age, race and gender.</p><p>The rapidly rising doubts about his mental capabilities come amid frequent public gaffes that have led some members of his party to question his cognitive status as the White House tries to tamp down public concerns.</p><p>At this point in time, it’s hard to see how Mr. Biden can regain his footing. Actually, D.C. Democrats have been saying behind closed doors and off the record that such an idea is now more than doubtful – it’s actually to the point where it’s unimaginable.</p><p>Notable in The Time’s Saturday story about the poll, though, was how its reporting did not cover the primary liability and cause for Biden’s rapid decline in support: His noticeable and increasing cognitive decline.</p>]]></content>

      <title>GAO Identifies Sustainment Cost Overruns in DOD Weapon Systems, Urges Clarification</title>
      <link href="/2024/03/04/GAO-Identifies-Sustainment-Cost-Overruns-in-DOD-Weapon-Systems-Urges-Clarification/"/>
      <url>/2024/03/04/GAO-Identifies-Sustainment-Cost-Overruns-in-DOD-Weapon-Systems-Urges-Clarification/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/661c8a9fe8a6d.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently scrutinized the Department of Defense’s (DOD) Fiscal Year 2022 sustainment reviews, revealing cost overruns in nearly half of the weapon systems analyzed. According to the GAO report, seven out of 16 weapon systems exhibited sustainment cost growth beyond legal thresholds, prompting recommendations for enhanced guidance.</p><p>Deep Dive into DOD’s Sustainment Cost Challenges<br>The GAO’s analysis highlights a significant issue within the DOD’s management of weapon system sustainment costs. Despite the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Sustainment’s role in overseeing these reviews, the GAO found the existing guidance lacking in clarity. This ambiguity has led to inconsistencies in how cost estimates are presented, including variations in the time frame of the cost estimate, categorization of costs, and consideration of inflation effects. The report underscores the need for the DOD to address these discrepancies to ensure accurate and consistent reporting of sustainment costs.</p><p>GAO Recommends Enhanced Guidance<br>In response to the findings, the GAO has put forth several recommendations aimed at improving the DOD’s sustainment cost estimation processes. Central to these recommendations is the call for the DOD to implement clarifying guidance for sustainment review submissions. This guidance should specifically address how to consistently present cost estimate information, ensuring that all relevant factors such as time frame, cost categories, and inflation are adequately considered. The aim is to provide a more reliable foundation for assessing and managing the long-term sustainment costs of the DOD’s weapon systems.</p><p>Implications for the Defense Department<br>The report’s findings and recommendations have significant implications for the DOD’s fiscal management and operational readiness. By addressing the GAO’s concerns, the DOD can achieve greater transparency and accuracy in its sustainment cost estimates, ultimately leading to more informed decision-making processes. This is not only crucial for the efficient allocation of defense resources but also for maintaining the readiness and capability of the U.S. military’s weapon systems. As the DOD works to implement the GAO’s recommendations, the focus will be on enhancing the sustainability and effectiveness of its defense capabilities in an economically responsible manner.</p><p>The Government Accountability Office’s scrutiny into the Department of Defense’s sustainment cost management practices sheds light on the need for clearer guidelines and more consistent reporting. As the DOD takes steps to refine its processes in line with the GAO’s recommendations, the outcome will likely influence not only fiscal discipline but also the strategic readiness of the United States’ defense apparatus. This report serves as a critical checkpoint for the DOD, pointing the way toward more sustainable and cost-effective management of the nation’s defense resources.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/armyoverhaul.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>US Army is slashing thousands of jobs in major revamp to prepare for future wars.</p><p>The U.S. Army is slashing the size of its force by about 24,000, or almost 5%, and restructuring to be better able to fight the next major war, as the service struggles with recruiting shortfalls that made it impossible to bring in enough soldiers to fill all the jobs.</p><p>The cuts will mainly be in already-empty posts — not actual soldiers — including in jobs related to counter-insurgency that swelled during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars but are not needed as much today. About 3,000 of the cuts would come from Army special operations forces.</p><p>At the same time, however, the plan will add about 7,500 troops in other critical missions, including air-defense and counter-drone units and five new task forces around the world with enhanced cyber, intelligence and long-range strike capabilities.</p><p>According to an Army document, the service is “significantly overstructured” and there aren’t enough soldiers to fill existing units. The cuts, it said, are “spaces” not “faces” and the Army will not be asking soldiers to leave the force.</p><p>Instead, the decision reflects the reality that for years the Army hasn’t been able to fill thousands of empty posts. While the Army as it’s currently structured can have up to 494,000 soldiers, the total number of active-duty soldiers right now is about 445,000. Under the new plan, the goal is to bring in enough troops over the next five years to reach a level of 470,000.</p>]]></content>

An AP reporter also attended, along other with law enforcement officials.</p><p>Some expressed frustration about missed red flags and questioned why the gunman was able to get the weapon he used. Dettelbach told his audience that they can be a powerful catalyst for change.</p>]]></content>

Greg Abbott said.</p><p>At a news conference on Friday, Abbott announced the construction of what he said would a new “base camp” that could house up to 2,300 soldiers.</p><p>“As opposed to being scattered around many different places across this region, they will be operating out of one place. It will amass a large army in a very strategic area. It will increase the speed and flexibility of the Texas National Guard to be able to respond to crossings,” Abbott said.</p><p>Officials expect that by mid-April they’ll have a 300-bed capacity and will add another 300 each month until completion, Texas Maj. Gen. Thomas Suelzer, Abbott’s top military adviser, said at the Friday press conference. The camp will include several features like large dining halls, individual rooms for soldiers and medical care facilities.</p><p>The move may also deepen the tension between the state and federal governments as Abbott continues to implement his own strategies to deter migrants from crossing in between ports of entry at the southern border.</p>]]></content>

We probably helped Ukraine, probably $100 billion or so, and we can’t get debt relief for American citizens in this country,” he told Fox News in an interview.</p><p>“We’re providing Israel and other parts of the world billions of dollars in relief and, in one instance, we even provided Ukraine farmers with financial relief.

Scattered showers and some possible thunderstorms would bring light to moderate rain, but there was still the threat that many places could see brief, fierce downpours dumping a half-inch to an inch ( 1.3 to 3 centimeters) of rain in an hour.</p><p><img src="/image/GettyImages1981164744.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>Authorities warned people to remain on high alert and most of Southern California remained under flood watches. Swollen and fast-moving creeks and rivers “increase the risk for drowning and the need for swift water rescues,” the weather service said.</p><p><img src="/image/GettyImages1989124381.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>The storm plowed through Northern California over the weekend, killing three people who were crushed by falling trees, then lingered over the south. It was the second storm fueled by an atmospheric river to hit the state over the span of days.</p><p><img src="/image/AP24036593684695.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>On Monday, it deluged Los Angeles with rain, sending mud and boulders down hillsides dotted with multimillion-dollar homes while people living in homeless encampments in many parts of the city scrambled for safety.</p><p><img src="/image/GettyImages1980644564.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>Near the Hollywood Hills, floodwaters carried mud, rocks and household objects downhill through Studio City, city officials said.

Over and over again, it attempts to gaslight the American people into voting for another term of failed Bidenomics with statements like… “While the U.S. economy is broadly healthy” — and — “The U.S. economy is currently performing better than most forecasters expected a year ago.”</p><p>The AP wants us to forget the truth of how Bidenflation has gutted everyone’s purchasing power and the consequences of that:</p><p>Americans held more than $1.05 trillion on their credit cards in the third quarter of 2023, a record, and a figure certain to grow once the fourth-quarter data is released by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. next month. A recent report from the credit rating company Moody’s showed that credit card delinquency rates and charge-off rates, or the percent of loans that a bank believes will never be repaid, are now well above their 2019 levels and are expected to keep climbing.</p><p>These worrisome metrics coincide with the average interest rate on a bank credit card of roughly 21.5%, the highest it’s been since the Federal Reserve started tracking the data in 1994.</p><p>Biden flooded a country that already has a housing shortage with roughly eight million illegal aliens… Biden flooded a country already dealing with crippling inflation with roughly eight million illegal consumers… Biden flooded a country already dealing with stagnant wages with roughly eight million illegal cheap employees…</p><p>“You have these noticeable pockets of consumers — mostly middle- and lower-income renters who have not benefitted from the wealth effect of higher housing prices and stock prices,” Warren Kornfeld, a senior vice president at Moody’s, told the AP. He added that these people “are feeling financial stress, and that’s driving up these delinquency levels. They’ve been hit very hard by inflation.”</p>]]></content>

      <title>How one city took on rising car thefts — and brought the numbers down</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/gettyimages.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>In the past two years, car thefts have skyrocketed in many U.S. cities, driven by a trend targeting Kias and Hyundais.</p><p>In Chicago, 80 cars on average were stolen every day last year. In Minneapolis, a woman’s car was reportedly targeted three times in six months. But just across the Mississippi River in St. Paul, Minn., a very different story is playing out.</p><p>Thefts began to balloon nationwide in the summer of 2022, after a TikTok video exposed a security vulnerability in certain models of Kia and Hyundai cars that made them easier to steal. Asher says the original video was up for only a few weeks, but that was enough time for it to spread.</p><p>And there was an increase in motivation. The videos became a challenge, especially among teenagers, to steal cars and then upload their own videos to social media. Some people would even time themselves to show how fast they could do it.</p><p>Nationwide, auto thefts have more than doubled since 2019, according to newly released CCJ numbers looking at 34 cities. Last year alone, car thefts rose nearly 30%.</p><p>It has gotten so bad that 18 state attorneys general sent a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration urging a recall of the affected cars. </p>]]></content>

Adam, a former field organizer for Biden telling Jeff that he will not vote for Biden again even knowing that it may help Trump. He says Biden is just some, not somebody I can trust. How big of a problem is this for Biden right now?”</p><p>Jones said, “It’s a big problem for him right now. There are four syllables that are aimed at him. Genocide Joe. That is becoming something you’re hearing from the younger voters in the Arab American community.”</p><p>He added, “I think he can turn it around but you’ve got to be honest right now. You’ve got disappointment in the base with how he’s handling the war in Gaza. Now the reality is Joe Biden is deep ties and friendships in the Muslim Arab community.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/S6SWJETJ75O7NE6GUHA3J7MILU.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden’s approval rating declined in January as Americans worried about the economy and immigration while the Democrat ramps up his reelection campaign, according to a Reuters&#x2F;Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.</p><p>Only 38% of poll respondents said they approved of Biden’s performance as president, down from 40% in December.</p><p>His public approval rating has held below 50% since August 2021, stirring concern among his fellow Democrats as he faces an expected election rematch with Republican former President Donald Trump in November. A separate Reuters&#x2F;Ipsos poll earlier this month showed Trump with a six percentage-point lead in that matchup.</p><p>The latest poll found rising concern about immigration, with 17% of respondents listing it as the most important problem facing the U.S. today, up sharply from 11% who cited as the most pressing issue in December. It was the top concern of Republican respondents, with 36% citing it as their main worry, above the 29% who cited the economy.</p><p>Biden’s administration has struggled to cope with a surge of asylum seekers on the U.S.-Mexico border, while Republicans in Congress, egged on by Trump, have threatened to scuttle a bipartisan attempt to tackle the problem. They are pressing ahead with an effort to impeach Biden’s top border official, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Majorkas.</p><p>U.S. border authorities struggled in December to process migrants as apprehensions reached nearly 11,000 in a single day, which officials said was near or at a record high.</p><p>The economy remained Americans’ overall top concern, cited by 22% of poll respondents, as they have struggled with inflation and other aftershocks of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Nearly two-thirds of respondents, including 47% of Democrats, said the country was on the wrong track.</p><p>The online poll of 1,019 U.S. adults was conducted Friday through Sunday. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points for all respondents, 6.4 points for just Republicans and 6.1 points for just Democrats.</p>]]></content>

Kristi Noem tells state lawmakers that South Dakota should send National Guard soldiers and equipment to support Texas in its efforts to turn back a tide of illegal immigrants at America’s southern border.</p><p>The governor visited the border at the end of last week and says conditions there are getting worse, blaming the Biden administration for what she says is a dramatic increase in illegal border crossings.</p><p>The governor said while many people coming to America are legitimately seeking a better life, she also says there are several Latin American countries taking advantage of the situation.</p><p>“South Dakota is directly affected by this invasion. We are affected by cartel presence right here on our tribal reservations, by the spread of drugs and human trafficking throughout our communities and by the drain of our resources at the local, state and the federal level,” the governor explained.</p><p>Noem says there is a legal argument that can be made that South Dakota would be well within its right to provide substantial assistance to Texas as the state works to control its border with Mexico.</p><p>“We’re currently exploring various legal options on how we can support Texas enforce federal government to do their job,” Noem said. “I’m also consulting with my adjutant general, with the secretary of public safety and with others; what our options are to provide personnel.”</p><p>An action Noem says the state can do right now is to send more razor wire to Texas for its operation. This is despite that the U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that the federal government can remove the wire and other barriers.</p><p>Immediately after Noem spoke to the Legislature, lawmakers passed a House concurrent resolution acknowledging the need to protect the country’s borders and affirming South Dakota’s support of the defense of the southern border.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/74EYOZSYBZHHNJ76GGX2Z7SFL4.png" alt="avatar"></p><p>A protest convoy warning of a migrant “invasion” at the U.S.-Mexico border left Virginia on Monday and began making its way toward Texas, where a standoff continued between the state and federal governments over border authority and security.</p><p>The convoy was organized in part by Pete Chambers, a former Army lieutenant colonel who spoke about the movement this week on shows hosted by right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and ousted Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson.</p><p>Chambers and other organizers urged veterans and service members to join their cause, writing on their website that they were calling on “all active and retired law enforcement and military, veterans, mama bears, elected officials, business owners, ranchers, truckers, bikers, media and law abiding, freedom-loving Americans.”</p><p>Scotty Saks, an organizer of the convoy and host of “Sovereign Radio,” claimed that active Navy SEALs and Green Berets were planning to join.</p><p>The “Take Our Border Back” convoy said it aims to pressure the federal government by holding a rally Feb. 3 in Quemado, Texas, which lies just 20 miles north of Eagle Pass. On orders from state Gov. Greg Abbott, the Texas National Guard rolled out concertina wire near Eagle Pass this month and prevented Border Patrol agents from accessing a popular migrant crossing.</p><p>In a 5-4 decision last week, the U.S. Supreme Court gave Border Patrol the authority to cut the concertina wire. The decision was narrow in scope, and while it says Texas can’t block federal authorities from the border, it doesn’t prevent the state from taking action. Twenty-five Republican governors issued a joint statement Thursday supporting Abbott, arguing that states have a right to self defense.</p><p>The tension between state and federal authorities comes amid record levels of unauthorized crossings at the border. Over the weekend, President Joe Biden claimed he would “shut down the border right now” if Congress authorized it.</p><p>In addition to the main event in Quemado, “Take Our Border Back” organizers are planning concurrent rallies in San Ysidro, California, and Yuma, Arizona.</p><p>As the Texas-bound convoy left from Virginia on Monday, organizers insisted their intent was to hold a peaceful protest to shed light on issues at the border and urge elected officials to take action to close it. However, the group was warning Tuesday of “infiltrators and provocateurs” who might be planning to disrupt their efforts, and extremism experts worried the situation could turn volatile.</p><p>“They’re calling for former law enforcement, former military, and so they’re looking for people who are tactically trained. That’s really not a necessity to be a protestor,” said Tom O’Connor, a retired FBI special agent who investigated domestic and international extremism for more than 20 years. “This could end very badly. Citizens clearly have a right to be angry over border issues and legally and peacefully protest their views … but sending down potential vigilantes to get in between the already tense state and federal law enforcement is probably not a great idea.”</p><p>O’Connor and Freddy Cruz, a researcher with the Western States Center, said they were disturbed by the group’s rhetoric about the border. Organizers posted updates about the convoy to the video platform Rumble and X (formerly Twitter), in which they often referred to an “invasion” of migrants. In one video, Saks argued, “We can’t sit by and watch our borders and language and culture being destroyed.”</p><p>That type of language perpetuates the “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory, which contends that lenient immigration policies are being designed to replace the power and culture of white people in the U.S., O’Connor and Cruz said. The theory has been tied to multiple mass shootings over the past several years, including the 2022 killing of 10 people in Buffalo, New York, and a shooting in El Paso, Texas, that left 23 people dead in 2019.</p><p>“This type of language is very dangerous in animating people to take on a vigilante role,” Cruz said. “It gets more scary when there’s already this tension between state law enforcement and federal agents in Eagle Pass, where immigration has become like a lightening rod. People need to be very responsible about how they’re discussing this in a public space.”</p>]]></content>

He left our troops as sitting ducks and now three are dead and dozens wounded, sadly as I’ve predicted would happen for months,” Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said in a statement.</p><p>“The only answer to these attacks must be devastating military retaliation against Iran’s terrorist forces, both in Iran and across the Middle East. Anything less will confirm Joe Biden as a coward unworthy of being commander-in-chief,” Cotton said.</p><p>Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said the Biden administration’s policy of deterrence against Iran “has failed miserably.”</p><p>“It was only a matter of a time before Biden’s appeasement strategy towards Iran got American service-members killed. Tragic and preventable,” Rep. Mike Waltz concluded.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/CIArecruiting.png" alt="avatar"><br>Running a social media campaign in Russia on X (formerly known as Twitter) in an attempt to recruit locals as potential CIA assets is unlikely to be successful, since the platform is blocked in the country, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has remarked.</p><p>On Monday, the CIA released a three-minute video in Russian appealing to the country’s citizens to tell the “truth” to American intelligence officials about what is really happening there. Doing so will help their motherland prosper and have a secure future, the video claimed.</p><p>Commenting on the video on Tuesday, Peskov noted that attempting to reach out to a Russian audience is “common practice” for intelligence agencies.</p><p>”Numerous secret services across the world quite often resort to mass media, and social networks to recruit new agents,” he said, adding that the CIA is no exception.</p><p>However, the spokesman added: “someone should have told the CIA that VKontakte [social media network] is much more popular in our country than X,” which has been blocked since March 2022 for discriminating against Russian media and allegedly spreading false information about the Ukraine conflict.</p><p>According to data provided by VKontakte, as of June 2023, its monthly audience was around 107 million people, of which 84 million are from Russia. Although similar statistics are not available for X, as of 2024, the number of users from Russia on the platform was estimated at about 767,000, according to the World Population Review analytical company. </p><p>In May 2023, the CIA created a Telegram channel where it shared instructions on how Russians could secretly get in touch with the intelligence agency. In November 2022, David Marlowe, the CIA’s deputy director of operations, said that the US was “open for business” with Russians who disapprove of Moscow’s actions against Ukraine. </p><p>At the time, Moscow’s embassy in Washington stated that the official’s remarks only confirmed that the US was continuing on a “hostile course” against Russia to “weaken our country from within through sophisticated subversive methods.”</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/image/JoeBidenHarpsonAbortionatFirstCampaignRallyinVirginia.png" alt="avatar"><br>Self-professed Catholic President Joe Biden is leveraging the killing of the unborn to drive his second presidential campaign forward.</p><p>At his first campaign rally in Virginia on Tuesday, the 81-year-old Democrat president focused entirely on abortion and blamed former President Donald Trump for installing three Supreme Court justices who ultimately helped to overturn Roe v. Wade, a 1973 decision which had invented the constitutional “right” to abortion.” The Supreme Court overturned Roe with its Dobbs decision in June of 2022 and sent the issue of abortion back to individual states.</p><p> The person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump,” Biden said, according to the Hill.</p><p>“The reason women are being forced to travel across state lines for health care is Donald Trump,” he added. “The reason their fundamental right has been stripped away is Donald Trump.”</p><p>The Biden administration is arguably the most pro-abortion presidential administration in American history, working through executive orders, rule-making and guidance from unelected government bureaucrats, and various legal challenges to install its abortion-on-demand agenda around the country and the world.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a><img src="/image/Continuousheavyrainfall.jpg" alt="avatar"></h2><p>Recently, there have been heavy rains or heavy rains in many places in Hebei, and local torrential rains, and the flood control situation is severe. At present, all cities in Hebei are going all out to prevent and respond to the work to ensure the safety of people’s lives and property.</p><p>In Jize County, heavy rainfall and upstream flood discharge caused the Ming River to flood beyond the flow rate in the county. Jize County quickly started the mass transfer and resettlement work. In the key flood control villages, the subcontractors, working groups, and rescue teams organized the masses to visit relatives independently and resettle them in a centralized way through broadcasting, WeChat, and household registration…</p><p>Jia Wentao, a member of the Dongshuangta Village Flood Prevention and Rescue Squad, Shuangta Town, Jize County, was in charge of relocating 523 people from 30 households in the west section of Shuangsheng Road. He said that from July 28 to 31, 93% of the people had been relocated, and the rest were Volunteers and strong young people can go to the front line when needed.</p><p>In order to cope with the flood situation and comprehensively consider the inflow of water from the upper reaches of the river, Hebei has opened a number of flood storage and detention areas. In Ningjin County, Xingtai City, the flood storage and detention area covers an area of more than 300 square kilometers, involving more than 150,000 people in 116 administrative villages. The county has set up a professional rescue team of 160 people and a mass rescue team of more than 13,000 people to organize relevant people to transfer and avoid danger.</p><p>At present, 8 of the 37 resettlement sites in Ningjin County have been activated, and all materials such as catering, disinfection, medical treatment, and heatstroke prevention are ready. According to statistics, as of the afternoon of the 31st, more than 2,000 people have been resettled in various resettlement sites in Ningjin County.</p>]]></content>

      <title>The flood discharge in Hebei and Tianjin is to protect Beijing? Experts explain the flood storage and detention areas in detail</title>

      <url>/2023/08/15/The-flood-discharge-in-Hebei-and-Tianjin-is-to-protect-Beijing/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a><img src="/image/Theflooddischarge.png" alt="avatar"></h2><p>Affected by typhoon “Du Su Rui”, the recent heavy rainfall in North China has been violent, wide-ranging, and high-intensity, and some rivers have experienced varying degrees of flooding. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has opened flood storage and detention areas to orderly divide and detain river floods. Up to now, Hebei Province has successively opened 7 flood storage and detention areas, and completed the transfer of 847,400 people.</p><p>Flood storage and detention areas are an important part of my country’s river basin flood control and disaster reduction system. They have played an irreplaceable role in the defense of previous major floods in river basins, and basically guaranteed the safety of important cities and important flood control areas in the middle and lower reaches of rivers. According to statistics, from 1950 to 2021, 66 of the 98 national flood storage and detention areas were put into use for a total of 424 times, with a cumulative flood storage capacity of more than 140 billion cubic meters. The flood storage and detention areas successively opened in Hebei this time were also used in the Haihe River Basin floods in 1963 and 1996.</p><p>Cheng Xiaotao, deputy chief engineer of the China Academy of Water Resources and Hydropower Research, introduced that flood storage and detention areas are an important part of the flood control system. They are low-lying areas and lakes outside river embankments that temporarily store floodwater, and most of them are places where rivers have been flooded in history. When the flood is too large, the timely distribution and storage of the flood and the reduction of the flood peak can minimize the disaster loss.</p><p>“News+” reporter: What is a flood storage and detention area?</p><p>Cheng Xiaotao: Flood storage and detention areas are an important part of the flood control system. Floodwater can be temporarily stored in low-lying areas on both sides of the river, or in wetlands or lakes.</p><p>Both sides of the river are not all highlands, and there are also low-lying areas. In the past, as long as the water rose, it was easy to be flooded. As populations grew and dams were built along rivers, these lower-lying areas were much less likely to flood. Slowly, some low-lying lands were reclaimed into farmland, inhabited and gradually formed into villages.</p><p>When catastrophic floods occur, in order to reduce the pressure on downstream cities, it is necessary to reduce the peak flow of the river. Therefore, some flood diversion and storage areas were set up. When the flood peak passed through the flood diversion and storage areas, the flood was diverted to the areas outside these embankments by opening gates or opening dikes.</p><p>Historically, these flood diversion processes may have been formed naturally. In the past, when major floods occurred, these areas would also be flooded, but now they have become flood storage and detention areas.</p><p>However, the existing dikes and pumping stations have effectively reduced the probability of flooding in these areas. Usually, another embankment is built in the flood storage and detention area to prevent the water flowing into the flood storage and detention area from spreading everywhere after the flood occurs. Flood is stored and stagnated in the flood storage and detention area, and the water in the flood storage and detention area is discharged back into the river after the river flood peak passes and the water level drops.</p><p>“News+” reporter: Why should flood storage and detention areas be designated?</p><p>Cheng Xiaotao: The size and depth of cross-sections of different rivers are different, so the ability of rivers to discharge floods is also different. When the flood volume exceeds the flood capacity of the river, the river may flood.</p><p>In order to improve the flood-carrying capacity of the river, we built embankments along the river, which is equivalent to expanding the flood-carrying section. But the dikes are very long, and we can’t ensure that every place can prevent flooding. In order to avoid flooding, we have to carry out full-line defense and set up flood storage and detention areas, so as to clarify the flood diversion area and reduce the flood control pressure of key protected areas. Such areas that are planned to be flooded by floods are called flood storage and detention areas, which are essentially a measure to relieve the flood control pressure of the entire river course and divert floods to protect key points.</p><p>The flood that flows into the flood storage and detention area will return along the original route after the water level of the main river channel drops. This process is called “water retreat”. In some flood storage and detention areas, a flood diversion sluice is opened upstream, and at the same time, there is a sluice retreat downstream, both of which can draw back the water, and the flood in these areas is temporarily stopped.</p><p>“News+” reporter: How do you view the statement that “Hebei and Tianjin flood discharges are to protect Beijing”?</p><p>Cheng Xiaotao: I don’t think this is a very accurate statement. The application of the flood storage and detention area is considered at the scale of the river basin. Generally speaking, the effectiveness of the flood storage and detention area is for the downstream, not the upstream. Therefore, the application of the flood storage and detention area is for Tianjin. The lower water level in Tianjin does not mean that Beijing will not be flooded.</p><p>“News+” reporter: After the flood discharge, how will the living order of the residents in the flood storage and detention areas be restored?</p><p>Cheng Xiaotao: The flood storage and detention area is not only an important part of the flood control system, but also the home of the people living in the flood storage and detention area. The people in the flood storage and detention areas are also citizens of the People’s Republic of China, and they also have the right to development. It does not mean that they should be sacrificed.</p><p>So when the “Flood Control Law of the People’s Republic of China” was enacted in 1997, it was clarified that if the state uses flood storage and detention areas, compensation should be paid. The “Interim Measures for Compensation for Flood Storage and Detention Areas” promulgated in 2000 also has a detailed description of the compensation standards.</p>]]></content>
